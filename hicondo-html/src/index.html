            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h3>Legalities</h3>
            <ul>
                <b>The contract</b>
                <li>Myth: The rental contract is bulletproof, and we are bound by all of its terms.</li>
                <li>Fact: Any part of the rental contract that violates Dutch law is invalid.</li>
                <li>There are several parts of the contract that have already been established as illegal: The amount of time the landlord has to return the security deposit, the termination notice period, and in many cases the security deposit, to name a few.</li>
                <li><b>Just because the landlord says something is legal does not mean it's true.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What if the landlord retaliates?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Myth: We are at the landlord's mercy.</li>
                <li>Fact: We have a lot of legal protection.</li>
                <li>It is very difficult for landlords to evict tenants even when they have actually valid reasons.</li>
                <li>If the landlord threatens to evict you for simply asserting your rights, refusing to pay a fine, or anything that is not covered by law, that is harassment and intimidation.</li>
                <li>Harassment and intimidation and refusing to perform maintenance are grounds for fines beginning at 20,000 for a first offense and escalating to 90,000.</li>
                <li>In extreme cases, the Gemeente has the authority to replace the landlord.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What can we do about harassment and intimidation?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We will soon start collecting anonymous reports of any behavior like this.</li>
                <li>We also encourage people to report these things directly themselves to (add a link here).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Who is HuurCommissie?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HiCo Bewonerscommissie</li>
                <li>We are a group of HiCondo tenants working with Stichting !Woon and other organizations to educate tenants about their rights and to help make HiCondo a better place to live.</li>
