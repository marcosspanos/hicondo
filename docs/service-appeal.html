            <h2>Service Costs Appeal</h2>
            <p>Do you think that you were charged too much in your service costs settlement?</p>
            <p>You're probably right, and you may be entitled to a refund!</p>

            <h3>Did you know?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Netherlands, a record-breaking number of service cost appeals were filed in 2023.</li>
                <li>The Huurcommissie ruled in favor of HiCondo tenants in 100% of the appeals filed for 2021 (ruling issued early 2025), with most tenants receiving 750€-1000€!</li>
                <li>For the 2021 cases, the landlord asked the Huurcommissie to approve charging normal business costs (e.g., employee salaries, security camera installation in 2016, and batteries for door locks) as service costs. The Huurcommissie, of course, said no.</li>
                <li>40+ HiCondo tenants have already begun the appeal process for 2022 and 2023.</li>
                <li>You can appeal the costs with legal representation from !WOON, with minimal effort and absolutely no cost to you!</li>
            </ul>
