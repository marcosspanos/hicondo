            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Legalities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Contract</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Myth: The rental contract is bulletproof, and we are bound by all of its terms.</li>
                        <li>Fact: Any part of the rental contract that violates Dutch law is invalid.</li>
                        <li>There are several parts of the contract that have already been established as illegal: the amount of time the landlord has to return the security deposit, the termination notice period, and (in many cases) the security deposit, to name a few.</li>
                        <li><b>Just because the landlord says something is legal does not mean it's true.</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>What if the landlord retaliates?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Myth: We are at the landlord's mercy.</li>
                        <li>Fact: We have a lot of legal protection.</li>
                        <li>It is VERY DIFFICULT for landlords to evict tenants, even when they actually have valid reasons.</li>
                        <li>If the landlord threatens to evict you for simply asserting your rights, refusing to pay some fine, or anything that isn't covered by law, that is HARASSMENT/INTIMIDATION.</li>
                        <li>Harassment, intimidation, and refusing to perform maintenance are grounds for fines, "beginning" at €20,000 for a first offense and escalating to €90,000.</li>
                        <li>In extreme cases, the Gemeente has the authority to replace the landlord.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>What can we do about harassment, intimidation, etc?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We will soon start collecting anonymous reports of any of this behavior, working with !Woon to ensure the Gemeente acts.</li>
                        <li>We also encourage people to report these things themselves: <a href="https://meldingen.amsterdam.nl/incident/beschrijf" target="_blank">https://meldingen.amsterdam.nl/incident/beschrijf</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Dealing with the landlord:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We encourage you to have all communication via email, to establish a record of communication.</li>
                        <li>If you must speak to them in person or via phone, record the conversation. The Netherlands only requires one party consent: if you're one of the parties participating in the conversation, you can legally record it.</li>
                        <li>DO NOT give into pressure or threats. You have rights, and we know how to help you enforce them. Contact us for help!</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Who is...?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>What is the HiCo Bewonerscommissie (tenants' committee)?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We are a group of HiCondo tenants, working with Stichting !Woon and other organizations to educate tenants about their rights and to help make HiCondo a better place to live.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>What is Stichting !Woon?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>!Woon is the Gemeente (municipality) of Amsterdam's tenant resource center. They assist tenants and tenants committees with landlord problems, especially in cases of getting refunds of overcharged service costs and illegal deductions from the security deposit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>What is the Gemeente?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Gemeente is the municipal (city) government. Their Good Landlord Team investigates tenant complaints regarding violations of the Good Landlordship Act. They can investigate and fine landlords for failing or refusing to address maintenance issues, harassing/intimidating tenants, and other violations.</li>
                        <li>If you were charged more than two times your monthly "kale"/"cold" rent as a security deposit, your contract started at July 1, 2023 or later, and you still live at HiCondo, this is illegal, and the Gemeente can force the landlord to refund the overcharged amount.</li>
                        <li>If you already moved out and the landlord withheld any part of your deposit for any reason other than damages or unpaid rent/costs, contact !Woon. (NOT "future service costs settlement" - this is illegal), you can get the back via !Woon and the Huurcommissie.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>What is the Huurcommissie?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Huurcommissie is the Dutch national rent tribunal. They handle disputes about rent, service costs, and deposits. They can order landlords to refund overcharged amounts and can lower your rent if it is too high for the property.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
